# To-Do-List-Manager

This Python script implements a command-line To-Do List Manager using a class-based approach. The primary goal is to provide a simple and interactive way to manage daily tasks, including adding, marking as completed, removing, and displaying tasks. The script reads and writes tasks from/to a text file to persist the to-do list across sessions.
